STEPS:
1.- Download suspamsub.exe
2.- Store it in "C:\"
3.- Execute it there and select C:\ as destination folder (if not already done by default)
4.- Access to the directory created and execute the reg_addition.bat file with administrator privileges
5.- Test the Suspicious Spam Submission Application from the Desktop (right click and select "Check_SPAM"

VERBAL EXPLANATIONS:


The file suspamsub.exe is a self-extracting executable that will unzip the main program in exe format besides the corresponding dependencies.

In order to properly work from the context menu (right click in a clean surface of the desktop), a registry modification is needed.

This means that the first thing to do, once the exe had finished extracting the files, is executing the batch file (reg_addition.bat).

After that, to test the program, you will only have to right click while in the Desktop and select "Check_SPAM". This will open a file dialogue for you to select a file to evaluate.

ThatÂ´s all.
